# Intelligent System Failure Prediction Dashboard (ISFPD)

## Project Type
Academic Semester Project

## Overview
The Intelligent System Failure Prediction Dashboard (ISFPD) is an academic project
designed during my semester to predict potential IT system failures using real-time
metrics and machine learning-based anomaly detection.

## Problem Statement
Traditional monitoring tools are reactive and notify teams only after failures occur.
This project focuses on proactive detection to minimize downtime and operational risk.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Machine Learning: Python (Anomaly Detection)
- Real-Time Communication: WebSockets

## System Architecture
Data Sources → Backend APIs → ML Engine → MongoDB → React Dashboard

## Key Features
- Real-time system metrics visualization
- Failure risk scoring based on anomaly detection
- Predictive alerts before system failure
- Admin dashboard for monitoring system health

## My Role & Responsibilities
- Designed end-to-end system architecture
- Defined data flow between backend, ML engine, and frontend
- Designed dashboard UI and monitoring components
- Implemented anomaly detection logic conceptually
- Documented system workflows and technical design

## Current Status
Code is not currently available due to academic environment constraints.  
This repository contains project documentation only.  
Planned future updates include full implementation and model optimization.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with cloud monitoring tools
- Advanced ML models for higher accuracy
- Alerting via email/SMS
- Dockerized deployment
